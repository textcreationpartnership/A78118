            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHether there be not ſufficient in the Bible, as it is tranſlated into Engliſh, for Believers under the Goſpell to prove their Faith, and Order or Church-fellowſhip by, without any tradition of men, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28. teaching them to obſerve whatſoever I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you, and lo I am with you alway, even to the end of the world; according to <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 3.14, 15, 16, 17. But continue thou in the things which thou haſt learned, and haſt been aſſured of; knowing of whom thou haſt learned them, And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> form a childe thou haſt known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wiſe unto ſalvation, through faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus: All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſſe, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good workes; Compared with Rev. 22.18, 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q</hi> 2. Whether Chriſt Jeſus hath not given as plain and perſpicuous a rule under the Goſpel, to Believers in all their Adminiſtrations to the end of the world, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did to the Jews under the Law Deut. 4.2. Iſa 8.20. Jer. 6.16. Joh. 5.39. Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for in them you think to have eternall life, and them are they that teſtifie of me: compared with Epheſ. 4 8.11. to the 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 3. Whether any thing may be brought into the worſhip of God, for matter or form, that is not expreſt in the Goſpell, or the Epiſtle of the Apoſtles, ſeeing the Jewes were required ſo ſtrict obedience under the Law; as it was given of God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut 12.32. What thing ſoever I command you to obſerve do it, thou ſhalt not adde thereto nor diminiſh from it: compared with Pro. 30.6. But believers much more under the Goſpell, as given by Chriſt: Heb. 1.1, to the 4. and 2.1, to the 5. and 3.1, to the 4. and 10.28, 29. He that deſpiſed <hi>Moſes</hi> Law died without mercie, under two or three witneſſes: Of how much ſorer puniſhment ſhall he be thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, who hath trodden under foot the Sonne of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was ſanctified, an un-holy thing, and hath done deſpight unto the ſpirit of Grace?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 4. Whether actuall Believers, confeſſing ſins, and profeſſing faith, with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:134555:2"/>deſire of the Ordnance, be not the true ſubject of Baptiſme or Dipping: And the right form, Dipping or Burying in water, not Sprinkling with water, it being not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rule and inſtitution of Chriſt and the primitive Churches practice, Mat. 28 19, 20. Acts 2.37, 38. and 8.12, 13. But when they believed <hi>Philip,</hi> preaching to them the Kingdome of God, and the name of Jeſus Chriſt, they were all dipt both men and women, compared with verſes 36, and 37. Rom. 6.4. Coll. 2.10. And this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in ſhew by Godfathers and Godmothers, commanding the Prieſt to dip the childe, as is cleer in the Rubrick: And whether the Adminiſtrator be not to go down into the water, as <hi>Philip</hi> with the Eunuch, Acts 3.38. and <hi>Iohn</hi> with Jeſus, Matth. 3.16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 5. Whether repentance and faith, with deſire of dipping, be not of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie to be required, according to the former Scriptures; and declared in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme ſet forth by authoritie, of every one that is baptiſed. And whether there be not the ſame ground for Common Prayer, Surplice, and the reſt, as for ſprinkling of Infants?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 6. Whether Chriſt commanded, or the Diſciples and Apoſtles ever practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the dipping (much leſſe the ſprinkling) of Infants of eight dayes old, or the like; or when or by whom it was firſt invented; which we finde to be one <hi>Fidus</hi> a Prieſt, and confirmed by <hi>Pope Innocentius</hi> about 300 years after Chriſt: And whether ſuch as ſeek to uphold it by Scripture, be not thoſe falſe accuſers <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, 2 Tim. 3.3. In that they pretend Scripture for it, when both the Church of Rome, Councels and Fathers (as they call them) confeſſe it to be but a Tradition: And whether the Inventers and upholders declare not themſelves worſe then <hi>Balam,</hi> Numb. 22.18, who being ſent for by <hi>Balack</hi> to curſe the people of God, and ſo to be raiſed to great promotion, anſwered; <hi>If</hi> Balack <hi>would give me his houſe full of ſilver and gold, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go beyond the Word of the Lord my God, to do leſſe or more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 7. Whether every one that looks for life, and ſalvation by Chriſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe faith in him, be not bound to partake of that one Baptiſme, Eph. 4.4, 5, and not content themſelves with any inventions of men: For as <hi>Eliah</hi> ſaid 1 Kings 18.21, how long halt ye between two opinions, if God be God follow him, if <hi>Baal</hi> be God follow him: So ſay I, if Dipping actuall Believers be Gods Ordinance, obey and imbrace it; If Sprinkling Infants be according to Chriſts inſtitution, prove it by the Scripture, and continue it: For as the Apoſtle ſaith, if he, or an Angell, bring any other doctrine then what they have received, or above what is written, let him be accurſed, Gal 189. 1 Cor. 46.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 8. Whether every particular Church of Chriſt or Aſſembly of Saints, in the order of the Goſpell, have not power from him their Head, to receive in, deal with, or caſt out their own Members, by the onely Lawes, Keyes, or Statutes of him their King and Law-giver, according to Iſ. 33.22. The Church of Ieruſalem, Corinth, or the Churches of Galatia, for Iames 4.12. there is one Law-giver who is able to ſave and to deſtroy, Acts 2.41 46, 1 Cor. 5 4, 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer</hi> 9. Whether Religion be to be forced or compelled by any paenall Laws and Statutes? Or if theſe Scriptures prove not the contrary: Pſal. 18.43. and 110.3. Math. 10.1, to the 16, and 20.1, to the 10, and 28.19. Mark 16.15, 16. 2 Cor. 10.3, 4, 5. 2 Tim. 2.24, 25. And whether the Civill Magiſtrate in forcing the conſcience, fulfils not theſe Scriptures, in giving their power and Kingdome to the Beaſt, Revel. 17, 12 to the 18. And whether as was ſaid by Chriſt, Matth. 23.32, to the 36, Fill yee up the meaſure of the Fathers, ye ſerpents, ye generation of Vipers, how can ye eſcape the damnation of hell; wherefore, behold I ſend unto you Prophets, and wiſe men,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:134555:2"/>and Scribes, and ſome of them ye ſhall kill and crucifie, and ſome of them ſhall ye ſcourge in the Synagogues, and perſecute them from Citie to Citie, that upon you may come all the righteous blood ſhed upon the earth, from the bloud of righteous <hi>Abel,</hi> unto the blood of <hi>Zacharias</hi> ſon of <hi>Barakias,</hi> whom ye ſlew between the Temple and the Altar: So whether the bloud, impriſonments, baniſhments, deaths, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, of what kinde ſoever, that hath been ſpilt of any of the Saints, that hath witneſſed for the truth ſince Chriſts death, our <hi>Abel,</hi> ſhal not be required of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and States where they have ſuffered. According to Iſa. 43.4. and Jer. 25.13, to the 18. and Rev. 18.21, 22, 23, 24, The Angel took up a ſtone like a great milſtone and caſt it into the Sea ſaying, thus with violence ſhall that great Citie Babylon be thrown down, and ſhall be found no more at all: And the voice of Harpers and Muſitians and Pipers and Trumpeters, ſhall be heard no more at all in thee: And no Craftſman of whatſoever craft he be, ſhall be found any more in thee, and the ſound of a milſtone ſhall be heard no more at all in thee, and the light of a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſhall ſhine no more at all in thee, and the voice of the Bridegroom and of the Bride ſhall be heard no more at all in thee, for thy Merchants were the great men of the earth, for by thy ſorceries were all nations deceived; and in her was found the bloud of Prophets and of Saints, and of all that were ſlain upon the earth: compared with Jude 15.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Whether Religion is to be fought for with carnall weapons by Believers, in the firſt publiſhing the Goſpell, for the planting or after preſerving the Churches of Chriſt? Or, if theſe Scriptures prove not cleerly the contrary, Mat. 10.16, Behold I ſend you forth as ſheep in the midſt of Wolves; be ye therfore wiſe as Serpents, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe as Doves, Mat. 16.24, 25, Then ſaid Jeſus unto his Diſciples, if any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſſe and follow me; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will ſave his life ſhall loſe it, and whoſoever will loſe his life for my ſake, ſhall finde it: 2 Cor. 10.3, 4, 5, For though we walk in the fleſh we do not warre after the fleſh, for the weapons of our warfare are not carnall, but mighty through God to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, caſting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God; and bringing into captivitie every thought to the obedience of Chriſt: compared with Epheſ. 6.11, to the 19. Col 1 24 Revel. 6.10, and 11.12. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their teſtimonie, and they loved not their lives unto the death: Their weapons as I conceive being onely Faith, Preaching, Prayers, Sufferings, and Tears, Mark 16.16. 2 Cor. 5.20. Now then we are Embaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us; we pray you in Chriſts ſteed be ye reconciled unto God; Ier. 9.1, and 13.17. 2 Cor. 12.15. And I will very gladly ſpend and be ſpent for you, though the more abundantly I love you, the leſſe I am beloved. According to Eccleſ. 9.17, <hi>The Words of Wiſe men are heard in quiet, more then the crie of him that ruleth among Fooles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 11. Whether Nationall or Pariſhionall Aſſemblies, be by divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Churches of Chriſt, now under the Goſpell, or a humane invention, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Primitive churches practice, as 1 Cor. 1.2. Unto the church of God which is in <hi>Corinth,</hi> to them which are ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, called to be Saints. Ioh. 15.19. <hi>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own, but becauſe ye are not of the world, but I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi> 1 Pet. 2, 5, 9, Ye alſo as lively ſtones, are built up a ſpirituall houſe, an holy Prieſt-hood, to offer up ſpirituall ſacrifices, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt. Verſ. 9. But ye are a choſen generation, a Royall Prieſthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people, that you
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:134555:3"/>ſhew forth the praiſes of him, who hath called you out of darkneſſe into his marvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous light: And that ſome would ſhew, how and by whom the Nationall or Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiall Aſſemblies, were firſt begun, contrived, or conſtituted?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 12. Whether God makes any covenant under the Goſpell concerning life and ſalvation, with any Pariſhionall church and their naturall ſeed, much leſſe with any Nationall; which is cleer he doth with all the Saints, and churches of Chriſt. Mark. 16.16, <hi>He that beleeveth and is baptiſed, ſhall be ſaved</hi> Rom. 2.6.7 Who will render to every man according to his deeds, to them who by patient continuance in well doing, ſeek for glory, honour, immortality, and eternall life; The contrary proved Mat. 3 7, 8 9. Rom. 9.7, 8. Gal. 3.6, 7, 8, 9.27, 28, 29. And therefore whether practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing contrary to the Scripture, pretending Scripture for their doings when there is none, be not as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, ſeeking deep to hide their counſell from the Lord, whoſe works are in the dark, turning things upſide down ſaying; who ſeeth us, or who knoweth us, ſaying of him that made them he had no underſtanding. Iſaiah 29.15, 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 13. Whether the Pariſhionall Aſſemblies, and the Miniſterie of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, have not their Conſtitution and calling from the Church of Rome, by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> the Monk? As we humbly conceive is to be ſeen in the Book of Ordination, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot.</hi> And whether ſuch as have their call from them, be not as truly Antichriſtian as theirs?

Whether it hath not been the practice of the falſe Prophets under the Law, and in the time of the Goſpel, for their owne ends to ſide with the times, and to be more in number then the true Prophets or Miniſters of the Goſpel: As in <hi>Eliahs</hi> time, 1 Kings 18.22. Where <hi>Eliah</hi> a Prophet of God alone, in appeareance, but <hi>Baals</hi> Prophets four hundred and fiftie, likewiſe in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eights daves, <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> what turning, ſiding and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving: As alſo when the Biſhops was in their power, what cringing and ſtooping, hiding and running their countries, whereas the true miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel were ever the ſame, though never ſo few in number, yet not variable, nor chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with times or State Governement, although they went through never ſo great perſecutions, which was a part of their portion, as Mark 10.3. Phil. 1.29. Where the Apoſtle exhorts the Philippians in no thing to bee terrified by their adverſaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of Salvation: and that of God: <hi>For unto you it is given in the behalfe of Chriſt, not onely to beleeve on him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake:</hi> And James 4.4. <hi>The friendſhip of the World is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with God, whoſoever therefore will be a friend of the World, is the Enemie of God, and</hi> John 14.19. <hi>If ye were of the World, the would world love his owne, but becauſe ye are not of the world, I have choſen you out of the World, therefore the World ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teh you.</hi>

Whether it be not a ſure marke to know the Miniſters of Antichriſt by their Pride, Idleneſſe, contempt of the poore Brethren, perſecution, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, contracting for hire, changing of places for greater wages, As what will you give me, and ile be your Miniſter, <hi>Iudas</hi> like, Matthew 26. What will you give me and ile be your Miniſter to deliver CHRIST into their hands: And they cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted for thirty peeces of ſilver; whereas the ſervants of CHRIST is to ſtrive to make the Goſpel free, Matthew 10.8. Freely ye have received; freely give: and 1 Cor. 4 12. &amp; 9.18. &amp; 2.12, 14, 15. Where the Apoſtle ſaith: He will not be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome unto them: For ſaith he I ſeek not yours, but you, for the children ought not to lay up for the parents; but the parents for the Children: And it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he which came to CHRIST, telling him that he would follow whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he went (was a Scribe) but he telles him: <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the birds of the ayre have neſts, but the Sonne of man hath not whereon to reſt his head,</hi> Mat. 8.19, 20. Luke 9 57,58.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quere</hi> 41. Whether the Miniſters, or rather the Servants: as 2 Cor 4.5. of the churches of CHRIST under the Goſpel, be not to be at the diſpoſing of the church whoſe ſervants they are, as is cleere: Acts 6.3. and 13.2. and 14.27. Colo. 4.17. And therefore not to be changing at their owne pleaſure, for a better Benefice rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er flocke, or greater hire: As too many doe, they diſpoſing of the church, not the church of them, who therein as <hi>Paul</hi> did: ſerve not the Lord CHRIST, but their own belly: And by faire words ſeeke to deceive the hearts of the ſimple: Rom 16.18. profeſſing they know God, but in workes they denie him, being abominable and diſobedient; and to every good worke reprobate, or voide of judgement, but as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; 1 Tim. 6.9.10. They that will be rich fall into Temptation, and ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtfull luſts, which drowne them in deſtruction and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, for the loue of money is the roote of all Eyill, which while ſome coveted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <hi>Q.</hi> 42. Whether one of the chiefeſt duties the Lord requires of that honorable high court of parliament be not, or had not been to relieve thoſe that have been oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the unjuſt courts and Judges. And whereas their Honours may be imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in greater affaires, there might not be ſome godly men appointed for that buſineſſe to relieve thoſe plundered Subjects, as well as a Committee for plundered Miniſters, whilſt there is releif to be had from their oppreſſors; And that becauſe the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that as Juſtice is to be Executed impartially: Leviticus chapter 10. verſe 15. Deuteronomie chap. 1. verſ. 17. and chapter 16. verſe 19.2. Chronicles chapter 19. verſe 7. Upon which doing, they might expect Gods ſpeciall preſence, as Iſaiah. chap. 58. verſe 4. to the 9th. So alſo it is to bee done ſpeedily, as 1 Kings chapter 20. verſe 42. and chapter 22. verſe 28.

And they gave forth their lots, and the lot fell upon <hi>Matthias,</hi> and hee was numbred by a common conſent with the Eleven Apoſtles, where common conſent is left out, and Acts. 14.23. Where the word Election is quite left out; untranſlated, Mat 28.19. where if with <hi>Paul</hi> wee deſired to ſpeake in a knowne tongue we, might have Baptizing, Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</p>

Daniel chapter 6. verſes 10.11. Acts chapter 4. verſes 18.19.20. So CHRIST himſelfe ſaith: John. 18.37. To this end was I borne and for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould beare witneſſe unto the truth: every one that is of the truth, heareth my voyce. and 1 Corinthinthians chapter 9. verſes 16. and 17. Where neceſſity was laid upon <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying, Woe unto me If I preach not the Goſpel, elſe hee might have been reproved as the evill Stewart, Matthew chapter 25. verſe 24. to the 30. verſe. So likewiſe ſhall every one that improves not the Talent which God betruſts them withall, eſpecially at this time, we having taken a Proteſtation againſt Poperie, and

Whether perſecution by Impriſoning, Silencing, Fining, Baniſhing, or taking away by death, for conſcience cauſe, were not firſt invented by the heathen or the Man of Sin, as to ſet up, ſo to uphold his bloody Kingdome; Frſt condemning the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of CHRIST, for heretickes; And then leaving them to the Civill Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to be tormented and executed, making them their executioners; and as the Papiſts in former times, ſo the Prelates Lately, And now the Presbyters, would be, which I conceive to be contrarie to theſe Scriptures, as Matthew the 7. chapter and the 12. verſe: Where CHRIST ſaith; <hi>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets,</hi> and Romanes the 13. chapter, and the third and fourth verſes, Rulers are not a terrour to good workes but to the evill, wilt thou then not be afraid of the power, do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame; for he is the Miniſter of God for thy good, but if thou doe that which is evill be afraid, for he beareth not the ſword in vaine, for he is the Miniſter of God, a Revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evill, as is largely laid downe in the 1. of Timmothie the 1. chapter and the 8. verſe, to the 12th. verſe, and the ſecond of Timothie chapter the ſecond verſe 24. and 25.</p>

Whether thoſe Miniſters which have recived, their Ordination and call from Antichriſt, ſhall have any hand at all, or not the leaſt in the publiſhing that Glorious and Everlaſting Goſpel, Revelation chapter 14. verſe 6. For the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the Kingdome of Antichriſt, and the ſetting up the Kingdome of CHRIST, according to Jeremiah chapter 49. verſe 20. and chapter 50. verſe 45. and chapter 51. verſe 24.25, and 26. compared with Matthew chapter 5. verſe 19. Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall break one of theſe Commandements, and teach men ſo, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdome of God, and Acts chapter 6. verſe 7. When the Word of God increaſed, and the number of the Diſciples multiplyed in Jeruſalem greatly, then a great companie of Prieſts were obedient to the faith, and Acts chapter 8. verſe 12.13. When Samaria had received the faith, and were Baptized, both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, then <hi>Simon</hi> himſelfe that had uſed Sorcerie, and bewitched the people for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, then he beleeved and was Baptized, but as in CHRISTS time, the Phariſees cried out, John the 7th. chapter and the 48. and 49 verſes; have any of the Rulers or of the Phariſees beleeved on him, but this people, which know not the Law, are cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; ſo now they uſually cry out, do any of the Learned walke in this way of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, To which I Anſwer, for my owne part, I am ſo farre frow wondring at it, that no more of them imbrace it, that conſidering the Apoſtles words the 1. of the Corinthians chapter 1. verſe 26. to the 30. that I admire to ſee ſo many: Yea any at all, coſidering the great meaſure of ſelfe deniall, that muſt be wrought in them beyond others, when they like the Converts, Acts chapter 19. verſe 19. that uſed curious Arts ſhall burne their bookes, And with <hi>Apollo,</hi> bee inſtructed by <hi>Aquila</hi> or <hi>Priſcilla, Acts</hi> 18. verſe 24, 25, 26. Two poore Diſciples, being by trade Tentmakers with whom <hi>Paul,</hi> wrought, he being of the ſame craft, verſe 1.2, 3,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:134555:7"/>And with <hi>Paul</hi> (Philippians chapter 3. verſe the 7, and the 8) count all things but loſſe and dung, that he might gain the knowledge of Chriſt; being willing to receive Inſtruction, and Baptiſme, though from <hi>Ananias</hi> a poore Diſciple. (Acts 9.17, 18.) And ſo as he adviſeth (1 Corinth. 3.18.) become a fool, that he may be made wiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quere</hi> 47. Whether the ſhutting up of houſes for infection, or the Plague, as they call it, be not a great heedleſſe burthen and oppreſsion to this Kingdome, and a meer invention, to the great grief of the perticular perſons, and abuſe of divers ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; contrary to the rule of Equity, and Chriſts command, who ſaith: Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, even ſo do you unto them. And at the laſt day, when Chriſt ſhall ſay, depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the divell and his Angels! One chief reaſon was, I was ſick and in priſon, and ye viſited me not: Will it be a good plea for them think you to ſay, thou waſt ſicke of the plague or ſickneſſe? Surely no. Chriſt excepts no diſeaſe, but ſaith, the haires of their head are numbred: And a Sparrow fals not to the ground without the providence of God, Matth. 10.29, 30, 31. Again, whereas many ignorantly would draw it from the ſhutting up of the Leproſie, you may eaſily perceive how groſſely they abuſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: Firſt, they were never ſhut up, as I humbly conceive, for fear of infection, but to keep the Congregation cleer; which rather typed the keeping out thoſe that were ſcandalous of life, and Excommunication to be paſt upon great offenders: As (in the firſt of the Corinthians, the fifth chapter, the 4, and 5, verſes) the Inceſtuous perſon was to be caſt out, but from the Leprous the Prieſt was not to keep, but <hi>Aron</hi> or his ſonnes was to have recourſe to them, and to look upon it upon all occaſions; As is cleer in the 13 Chapter of Leviticus throughout. But the Prieſts of theſe times, though they retain their Tithes, yet run from the Plague, as ſome of them have done from the Cavatiers, or after a rich Benefice, letting who will take the flock: Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith (chapter 10. verſes 10.12, 13) He that is an hireling and not the Shepheard, whoſe own the ſheep are not, ſeeth the Wolfe comming, and leaveth the ſheep and fleeth, and the Wolfe catcheth them, and ſcattereth the ſheep, the hireling fleeth becauſe he is an hireling, and careth not for the ſheep; but the good ſhepheard giveth his life for the Sheep. And as Chriſt the head, and true Shepheard, (Iſaiah 40.11. Ezek. 34.23. to the end of the chapter.) So his faithfull Miniſters and ſervants, as <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſes (Acts 21.13.) what mean ye to weep and break my heart, for I am ready not to be bound onely, but alſo to die at Jeruſalem, for the Name of the Lord JESVS.</p>

Hath not God made fooliſh the wiſedome of this world? for after that in the wiſedome of God, the world by wiſedome knew not God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching, to ſave them that beleive. And <hi>2 Cor. 8.12.</hi> it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not; for it is very probable, that this unnaturall War will never ceaſe, nor Prerogative of the King, priviledge of the Parliament, and Libertie of the Subject be obtained, till ſighting for the Goſpell with carnall weapons be laid down; and the conſcience left free for Chriſt, the King, Lord, and Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to rule by his own Lawes and Statutes, preſcribed in his VVord. <hi>Iſa. 33.22.

Let both grow together unto the Harveſt;</hi> though not in the Church, yet in the world Shewing a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit, for by their fruit ye ſhall know them. And conſider who muſt go up and perſwade <hi>Ahab,</hi> that he might go up and fall at <hi>Ramoth Gilead, 1 Kings 22.20, 21, 22.</hi> but a Spirit that would go forth, and be a lying ſpirit in the mouth of all his Prophets; and the Lord ſaid, thou ſhalt perſwade him, and prevail alſo, go forth and do it. Alſo <hi>Rev. 16.13, 14</hi> &amp; I ſaw three unclean ſpirits like frogs, came out of the mouth of the Dragon, and out of the mouth of the Beast, and out of the mouth of the falſe Prophet, which are the ſpirits of Divels, working miracles, and goe forth unto the Kings of the Earth, and of the whole world, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them to the Battle of that great day of God Almighty.</p>
